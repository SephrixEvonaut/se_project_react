# What To Wear

## Description of API Functionality:

    The website with two different APIs. First, we use openweatherAPI for weather; then a personal database for storing our different clothing articles. The database for clothingcards stores the appropriate imagery for each logged clothing piece, and along side it are its labels for appropriate weather categorization to be called upon through the JS/JSX infrasrtcuture.

## Description of Website Execution/Display Functionality:

    The website itself allows for the creation of new cards (clothing pieces). A modal can be opened, via add button in the header, for creating new clothing items and categorizing their associations in "hot" "warm" or "cold".  Beyond this we have all of our stored cards finalzied in a database and then run through the filtration logic of our JSX set up. We filter through weather conditions based off the data given to us on OpenWeatherAI.
